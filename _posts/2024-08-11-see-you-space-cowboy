Have you ever met someone that reminded you so much of your younger self - one that, with all their talents and dreams, took a different path from you. That experienced all the things you wished you had, but didn't, whether out of circumstance or choice. They think like you, have the same interests, have the same driving force. It's like yours and their dimensions briefly crossed, to show you all the things you could have been. 

You enjoy talking to them so much because it lets you pause time and reminisce about old dreams. But you know its all an illusion, because you are here now, and they are there, and when you say goodbye, the reality of your life comes back to surround you. Stay too long, and you get stuck in the past.

I am reminded of the story of Cowboy Bebop, about a group of bounty hounters constantly struggling to escape their past, but ending up right back where they started. From start to end, they are reminded of their past mistakes, mysteries, and regrets. Near the end, Spike, the main character has a way to finally move on, but he cannot, and decides to go back to confront his past, only to end up dying for it.

This week felt similar. This week I met that younger self - the person I wished I had been when I was 20. And when we talked, and I had realised how similar, yet different we were, I felt many things: regret about shutting off myself socially in school; melancholy about the person I might have been had I chosen to move abroad; but most importantly, grateful for the reminder that I can still change for the better.

I wanted the moment to last forever, to cling on to the hopes and dreams long gone. But they had to leave, fly far away, as swiftly as they had appeared to me. Even though it felt too fast, now I am thankful for that because I don't want to be pulled back into the could have's of the past. 

To my younger self, you may not know how much you've impacted me, but I will always remember this brief moment in time when we crossed paths. I hope we continue to stay in touch. But if we don't - then thank you, and see you, space cowboy...
