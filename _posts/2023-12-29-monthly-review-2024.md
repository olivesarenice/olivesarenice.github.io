# Feb 2024

## General

1. This month I felt: Imposter Syndrome
2. I completed these books and movies:

    - **Profit First by Mike Michalowicz** - in progress

        Got the main idea: always take profit first - in business, life, whatever. Instead of putting profit as the leftover after subtracting expenses, switch it around and think of expenses at the end. 

        Thus, in all activities, decide on how much profit to take and keep to it. If leftover amount for expenses is too little, then naturally you will need to increase revenue or reduce costs, but never at the sacrifice of that set profit amount. This gurantees a regular income. The actual amount of profit depends on the type and maturity of business - this is where margin % will determine the profit to take. Nevertheless, the idea is the same - profit first. This isn't just shrewd practice; it also ensures a sustainable business/ lifestyle.

## Q&A
### Health, Fitness, Nutrition
0. Rate performance in this domain: 4

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Moved gym days to M, W, F right after work
    - Why I did it: Optimise my sessions to be during my most energetic time of day and reduce travel times + less inertia since already out of house for work.
    - What it achieved: Felt much better at gym despite lesser sleep. More consistent overall, since I take less 2-day rest periods. However, coming back late is affecting home schedule.

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - N/A, just keeping at it. 

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Getting enough sleep. Currently averaging 7 hours but the good range is 7.5 to 8 hours.

    Because:

    - I generally get home later nowadays especially with gym at night. Also have to cook most days to get higher protein meals. All these little things add up into a late night, especially when I do them last after resting after dinner.

    To address this, I will:

    - Do all my chores **first** - eat dinner, smoothie, clean rubbish, brush teeth, etc. once home. Only after that can I relax. So either way, when the time comes, I can always just go to bed right away.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Frontload all chores once getting home | Reduce last minute chores before sleep | N/A |

### Social Influence
0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Went for 1 meet up this month
    - Why I did it: Part of the action plan to network more in the professional community
    - What it achieved: Not much, did not find many interesting meetups

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Starting a new job - meeting young and energetic colleagues

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Turning small talk into meaningful (and memorable conversations)

    Because:

    - I get bored of small talk easily and decide to not continue the conversation usually. If the person is quiet too, usually we just don't talk.

    To address this, I will:

    - Aim to talk to everyone about anything - specifically, I will gamify it and aim to get these items from the conversation:

        - the **why** behind something they said. e.g. what made you like _____? why did you choose to _____? 
        
        - what do they **really** do in their free time and more importantly **how** do they feel about it? This one is especially useful for separating people by how driven they are to pursue passions in their free time.

        Important: these 2 questions shouldn't be forced. They are generic enough to be applied to any topics so use them liberally.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Follow the gamified conversation targets | For practice | N/A |

### Professional Skills

0. Rate performance in this domain: 4

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Committed weekends and weeknights to working on projects and practicing my drone flights.
    - Why I did it: Part of spending my time more deliberately. This is also governed by my timeblocking which seems to be effective.
    - What it achieved: Cemented my habit of replacing gaming/ scrolling with meaningful activities. I feel more direction now (better than last time, but still a 6/10 at most - could be better)

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Massively improving my data engineering skills to build foundations for my data consultancy.

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Imposter syndrome in the team.

    Because:

    - I did not have the formal background in tech compared to everyone else, even the interns. And also there was a clear experience and skill gap between me and the others.

    To address this, I will:

    - Be very efficient in my learning so that I can overtake the rest. This means documenting my work and constantly checking if I am able to explain my work (and the team's work) to others in simple terms. This comes naturally through documentation so I need to keep up with that and not get lazy.

        How this will look like at work is: from say 1PM - 6PM on Friday (usually my most free day), pick a repository/ pipeline/ technology and document it fully. Describe how it works, read this description, try to poke holes in it where when I ask 'why do this?', I don't have the answer, then research and revise and repeat the questioning. This is basically the Feynman Method

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Allocate dedicated timeslots in the weekdays for self-learning (via documentation) and self-exploration (via new projects) | To speedrun my learning of the company's tech | N/A |
| Time blocking on calendar (from prev month) | To take out the mental work of finding a dedicated timeslot for deep work | Weekday nights = for paid work, Weekend 9am-12nn: projects/ CTF - the weekend mornings are especially important to protect | 

It will look something like this:

| Time | Weekdays | Sat / Sun |
| - | - | - |
|9am-12nn| Work |Protected project time|
|12nn-6pm| Work |Date|
|6pm-10pm| 2 gym sessions + 1 event + 1 paid gig (if any) / project | Family |

There will be pockets of time (0.5 - 1 hours) in between which should be kept empty so that I don't overload myself.

# Jan 2024

## General

1. This month I felt: Direction
2. I completed these books and movies:

    - **Death on the Nile**

        The least engaging of the 3 Hercule Poirot movies. Interesting setup, but reveal was predicatble, CGI and acting mediocre, and situation developed too slowly. 
    
    - **Uncut Gems** 

        Most anxiety-inducing film I've watched (that's not horror). Watch this if you feel like you need some chaos in your life.
    
    - **The World for Sale by Jack Farchy**

        This book is about the history of commodity (oil, metals, grains, etc.) traders. It looks at how these organisations are structured and their influence on geopolitics.

        3 takeaways:

        - A recipe for finding lucrative markets: 

                LOW REGULATION
                        +
                HIGH INFO ASYMMETRY
                        +
                CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION
        
        - Acknowledge the risks involved, reap the rewards, and suffer the consequences without pretending that your decision was anything more than a bet on your convictions.

            > "We're speculators," says Mark Hansen, chief executive of Concord Resources, a metals trader. "We don’t apologise for the fact that we do speculatively trade. **The worst things that have happened in this industry have happened when people pretended there wasn’t a speculative element to what they were doing**."

        - The most profitable (and successful) firms tend to run with a partnership model with profit-sharing incentives.

            Monetary incentives (pegged to influence on net profit) are the no. 1 motivator for the actions of employees. Specifically, rewards based on quantifiable and trackable performance targets are the most effective way to get people working. 

            After all, why should someone work to achieve beyond the baseline if monetary rewards are not proportional to their achievements? 

            For sales, this is a commission based on % of revenue because they indirectly raise net profits via volume. For traders, this is a direct commission on % of profits.

            What about roles associated with cost-reduction? Imagine an engineer who spent 4 years to create a system that, in total, reduces costs by $1,000,000 per year for 5 years (the value of their work is thus $5,000,000). They should be paid at least 20% of that value or $1,000,000. After all, the company has already reaped the remaining 80% ($4,000,000) as an increase in pure profit.
            
            This number includes their fixed compensation, assuming that this project was a core part of their job that were being paid for. Let's say they already earn $100,000/ year - that's $500,000 they would be compensated, and thus they should be rewarded with an extra $500,000. Of course the actual value of their work (per person) needs to consider the size of the team and other dynamics, but this model shows that rewards based on influence on net-profits can be applied to cost-cutting roles as well.

    - **The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins**

        This book is an onboarding guide for managers and more senior people who have less time to transition into a role and start producing value.

        It was a good introduce to the approach of structuring your onboarding in the first 3 months into blocks of 30-days each. In each block, you have different goals and activities.

        The whole point of doing this is to reach break-even point quickly. This is the point at which you have produced more than you have consumed - i.e. you are now a net-positive to the company.

        Alot of the book is targeted to senior positions where you have an influence over the company's strategy and those below you. However, there are parts that are essential for anyone starting a new job, no matter the level:

        1. Before starting a job, have a plan of what you will achieve in the next:

            - Before starting
            - Within 1st day
            - Within 1st week
            - Within 1st month

            This plan should change as you find out more about the job over the first few weeks.

        2. Things to do at onboarding (1st week)

            Most of these things can be found out by talking to your boss or teammates.

            - What is the business structure, priorities, profit drivers and major cost centers?

            - What is the current focus of our group/ team operating in - start-up, expansion, turn-around, sustain success, etc.?

            - Who/ what groups are the major influencers in the company, and how do they influence decisions (via hierarchy, expertise, profit drivers)?

            - Who are the key people to connect with in my role? - arrange introductions ASAP

            - Who are the stakeholders horizontal to me that can influence my work? - arrange introductions ASAP

            - Who can serve as a _'cultural interpreter'_? - people who have been there long enough to know the politics, lingo.

            - Set expectations and KPIs to be reviewed in 30 days. 

        3. Understand the company (more)

            Beyond the 1st week, also constantly look to ask about:

            - Organisation history - how did certain groups, positions, processes come into place? What were the issues faced back then?

            - How do the different units interact and where are the bottlenecks? - process mapping

            - Further mapping of influence networks - where are the sources of power and what are their motivations, constraints, fears.

        4. Negotiate success with boss

            - What are the deliverables they prioritise the most - how to set up quick wins consistent with these items within first 3 months?

            - Set measurable KPIs for each month and discuss them frequently

            - What is their communication style - reading, diagrams, talking? frequent back-and-forth, once a week in-depth discussion, report followed by response?

            -  Align resources needed to achieve expectations 

        5. Consider support systems

            - Form a diverse advisor network (Internal vs. External, Technical vs. Organisational)

            - Set out regular sessions monthly to plan

            - Defer commitment; say _"If you need an answer urgently, I have to decline. But let me look into this and get back to you"_

        The overall message is to **take ownership of your own learning and success in the company; assume zero initiative from boss.**

        The templates above serve as a good guide on **how** to go about this effectively.

## Q&A
### Health, Fitness, Nutrition
0. Rate performance in this domain: 3

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Adhered to the nutrition plan of either protein shake or smoothie with enough protein.
    - Why I did it: Part of the plan
    - What it achieved: Did not feel fatigure from lack of nutrition (but from lack of sleep instead)

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Going back to workout with friends at AFBV. Its definitely more interesting than working out alone 100% of the time

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Maintaining a regular gym schedule. My routine is stretching out to be 2 days rest in between on average, rather than 1 day rest.

    Because:

    - I did not properly plan my gym sessions, and when I did, I was usually too tired from going to office early to train properly. Still going back to the root problem of poor planning.

    To address this, I will:

    - Set up gym schedule at least a week in advance (put in calendar) to minimise overloading my evenings.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Set up proper gym scheduling in calendar | To manage the amount of activities done in a single evening | Possibly involve friends at gym so I have accountability to go on those days | 
| Continue nutrition plan | Working well, no complaints | - |

### Social Influence
0. Rate performance in this domain: 4

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Went for 2 (going 3) meet ups this month
    - Why I did it: Part of the action plan to network more in the professional community
    - What it achieved: Found an interesting and diverse community (Div0) that I would like to stick to. (see [link to post](LINK))

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Making new friends at Div0

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Finding the right (influential) people to talk to during the events and picking the right conversation topic.

    Because:

    - Many casual, first-time members of unknown background, talking to them randomly may not be efficient use of time. (I can only engage with max 5 people per event due to limited time to network after the talks)

    To address this, I will:

    - Properly research attendees and prioritise highly networked people (organisers, regular volunteers).
    - Prepare specific questions about the event, community - focus less on the talk's contents and more on the event background (especially for first time communities)

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Search for more diverse meetups for Feb (at least 2) | as part of meetup plan | Properly research the event and attendees |
|  Settle into the Div0 community (regular), especially the international speakers and members | expand network, make friends ||

### Professional Skills

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Managed to cut out and abstain from social media other than educational YT channels (this is part of the setup - Feedly, Youtube, eBooks)
    - Why I did it: I found everything else not interesting (just distracting and time-killing).
    - What it achieved: Watched a lot more educational content like documentaries on politics and technology. Useful even though they were not software-related. Stumbled across a video on how to start a data consultancy which was very useful.

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Strategising and setting the foundations for a data consultancy in the future, based on the guidance of a YT video I watched.

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Finding time to implement the software projects that I watched on Youtube

    Because:

    - My evenings are usually taken up by some networking or gym, and weekends were packed. Lack of energy from waking up early to go to office as well. 

    To address this, I will:

    - Set up my weekends, particularly Sat and Sun mornings to these projects. Evenings on weekdays have too much going on for me to concentrate.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Time blocking on calendar | To take out the mental work of finding a dedicated timeslot for deep work | Weekday nights = for paid work, Weekend 9am-12nn: projects/ CTF - the weekend mornings are especially important to protect | 

It will look something like this:

| Time | Weekdays | Sat / Sun |
| - | - | - |
|9am-12nn| Work |Protected project time|
|12nn-6pm| Work |Date|
|6pm-10pm| 2 gym sessions + 1 event + 1 paid gig (if any) / project | Family |

There will be pockets of time (0.5 - 1 hours) in between which should be kept empty so that I don't overload myself.

# Dec 2023

## General

1. This month I felt: 

    Optimistic about the future

2. I completed these books and movies: 

    - "How to Fight a War" by Mike Martin
    - The Italian Job

## Q&A

### Health, Fitness, Nutrition

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Maintained heavy workouts but < 3x/ week due lack of sleep or illness
    - Why I did it: Felt like I needed more rest to recover on days which I felt "off". Also felt that my performance would suffer if I went to the gym while not feeling 100%.
    - What it achieved: I'm not sure if it made my performance better overall, as even on my "off" days I could still hit PRs. 

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Taking supplements like ZMA and fish oil to test their effectiveness. I can't tell if they really worked because I've been feeling sickly most of this month.

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Getting consistent sleep cycle for gym

    Because:

    - Odd late night sprints to do work, coding projects, end-of-year parties
    - Constantly falling sick like flu and COVID

    To address this, I will:

    - Have better planning and less last-minute work. If there is a need to stay up late, prioritise next-day recovery by napping.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Start 2 scoops protein shake + supplements regime | NA | NA | 

### Social Influence

0. Rate performance in this domain: 1

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: None, was quite isolated this month
    - Why I did it: Did not follow through on the meetup habit after getting the new job.
    - What it achieved: NA

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Meeting old friends for Christmas parties

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Going to meetups

    Because:

    - I was focused on the job search and did not have the mindspace to plan these things.

    To address this, I will:

    - Register for meetups during my monthly review

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Go for 2 meetups in person | Kickstart habit again for networking | Already booked 2 meetups + 1 online webinar | 

### Professional Skills

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Explored use of StableDiffusion interfaces for creating AI Influencers. 
    - Why I did it: Saw a good opportunity for business using AI.
    - What it achieved: Learned about the capabilities and limits of StableDiffusion models. Images generated not convincing enough, but the bar is relatively low still. Still deciding whether to continue pursuing it. 

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Securing my new job

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Keeping up my learning, self-practice habit

    Because:

    - I didn't feel much excitement. Possibly because I am doing this alone, and don't have the community interest to sustain me.

    To address this, I will:

    - Tie in my professional skills to community meetups and sustain these relationships if I see that they are beneficial

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Set up YT app to only show curated content | Part of passive learning | Done | 
| Set up ebooks | Part of replacing scrolling with reading | Done |
