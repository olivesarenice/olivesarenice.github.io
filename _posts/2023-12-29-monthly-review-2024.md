# Dec 2023

## General

1. This month I felt: 

    Optimistic about the future

2. I completed these books and movies: 

    - "How to Fight a War" by Mike Martin
    - The Italian Job

## Q&A

### Health, Fitness, Nutrition

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Maintained heavy workouts but < 3x/ week due lack of sleep or illness
    - Why I did it: Felt like I needed more rest to recover on days which I felt "off". Also felt that my performance would suffer if I went to the gym while not feeling 100%.
    - What it achieved: I'm not sure if it made my performance better overall, as even on my "off" days I could still hit PRs. 

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Taking supplements like ZMA and fish oil to test their effectiveness. I can't tell if they really worked because I've been feeling sickly most of this month.

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Getting consistent sleep cycle for gym

    Because:

    - Odd late night sprints to do work, coding projects, end-of-year parties
    - Constantly falling sick like flu and COVID

    To address this, I will:

    - Have better planning and less last-minute work. If there is a need to stay up late, prioritise next-day recovery by napping.

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Start 2 scoops protein shake + supplements regime | NA | NA | 

### Social Influence

0. Rate performance in this domain: 1

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: None, was quite isolated this month
    - Why I did it: Did not follow through on the meetup habit after getting the new job.
    - What it achieved: NA

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Meeting old friends for Christmas parties

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Going to meetups

    Because:

    - I was focused on the job search and did not have the mindspace to plan these things.

    To address this, I will:

    - Register for meetups during my monthly review

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Go for 2 meetups in person | Kickstart habit again for networking | Already booked 2 meetups + 1 online webinar | 

### Professional Skills

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Explored use of StableDiffusion interfaces for creating AI Influencers. 
    - Why I did it: Saw a good opportunity for business using AI.
    - What it achieved: Learned about the capabilities and limits of StableDiffusion models. Images generated not convincing enough, but the bar is relatively low still. Still deciding whether to continue pursuing it. 

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Securing my new job

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Keeping up my learning, self-practice habit

    Because:

    - I didn't feel much excitement. Possibly because I am doing this alone, and don't have the community interest to sustain me.

    To address this, I will:

    - Tie in my professional skills to community meetups and sustain these relationships if I see that they are beneficial

4. Planned actions for next month

| Action | Reason | Details/ Updates |
| - | - | - |
| Set up YT app to only show curated content | Part of passive learning | Done | 
| Set up ebooks | Part of replacing scrolling with reading | Done |
| Set up Feedly news for important events | To keep up to date with world events | Done |
| Start CTF'ing again | Quite a fun activity | - |
