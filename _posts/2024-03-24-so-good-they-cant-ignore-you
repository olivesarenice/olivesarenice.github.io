# Summary

Recently read the book So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport and summarised it here. In essence, it is a compilation of the various 'productivity' techniques that I've arrived at, although before reading it I never had a way to organise these ideas into a cohesive framework.

Newport argues that a rewarding career is one that is built on craftmanship, control, and mission. True mastery over your craft - be it programming, sales, consulting, comes from practice and experience. With sufficient mastery, one can leverage these rare and valuable skills into more control over how they work, thus granting them control. Finally, having a consistent mission helps one to plan what exactly to do to gain this mastery step-by-step.

His 4 rules are:

1. Don't follow your passion (at least in the context of a career)

    Having a pre-existing passion that matches a feasible career choice is extremely rare. Usually, this makes people jump into lifestyles that are unsustainable because the person lacks the skills to pull off the career. People that are passionate about what they do didn't start out that way. Their passion developed over time and as they mastered their craft - this gave them more leverage and control over their life hence making their work more enjoyable.

    As an added benefit, if you don't follow your passion at the start, you don't have to fret whether each decision you make is aligned with your 'true calling', because there is none.

2. Career capital (or skill) is necessary for meaningful work. You accumulate career capital and become so valuable that you can sell your skills for money and on your own terms.

    To build it, you need to know what market you are building this capital in, and then practice deliberately.

3. Control over your career only comes after you have built the necessary career capital. In making the decision to take control over your career (e.g. starting your own thing) the single most important criteria that must be met is: "is someone (customer/ employer/ investor) willing to pay for this?"

4. Tying all this together requires mission, which will steer each of your actions in a series of 'little bets'. Actions which are small enough that feedback is frequent and actionable, yet still significant enough to move you along your mission.

# Actions

From this, I took away 2 ways to distill the things I'm already doing into super clear and super simple habits.

1. Place a daily 'time practiced' tracker on my desk.

    This is a way to make deliberate practice visible and accountable. Previously, I only had the reminder to 'code instead of game' - this trick lost its effectiveness over time without a way to track it, hence the need for a visible cue.

2. Before starting any deliberate practice, plan the scope and what I wish to achieve out of it. I realised that my projects usually fizzled out - that's fine, but there was no takeaway from them. I didn't document why I chose to stop pursuing it. Even worse, these 'projects' weren't really deliberate practice aimed at improving my craft. In fact, my 'craft' needs further refining.
