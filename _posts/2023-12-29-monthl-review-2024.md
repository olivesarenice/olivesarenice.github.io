# TEMPLATE MONTH

## General

1. This month I felt: 

    Optimistic about the future

2. I completed these books and movies: 

    - "How to Fight a War" by Mike Martin
    - The Italian Job


## Q&A

### Health, Fitness, Nutrition

0. Rate performance in this domain: 2

1. Actions I took this month 

    - What I did: Maintained heavy workouts but < 3x/ week due lack of sleep or illness
    - Why I did it: Felt like I needed more rest to recover on days which I felt "off". Also felt that my performance would suffer if I went to the gym while not feeling 100%.
    - What it achieved: I'm not sure if it made my performance better overall, as even on my "off" days I could still hit PRs. 

2. This month, I felt most excited about:

    - Taking supplements like ZMA and fish oil to test their effectiveness. I can't tell if they really worked because I've been feeling sickly most of this month.

3. I struggled most with action:

    - Getting consistent sleep cycle for gym

    Because:

    - Odd late night sprints to do work, coding projects, end-of-year parties
    - Constantly falling sick like flu and COVID

    To address this, I will:

    - Have better planning and less last-minute work. If there is a need to stay up late, prioritise next-day recovery by napping.
