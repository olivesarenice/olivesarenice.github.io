# Summary

2023 has been a whirlwind of a year with many changes and surprises. Funny enough, at the start of the year, my 'word of the year' for 2023 was `STABILITY`. Maybe it was because I anticipated the upcoming changes, or I was simply trying to stabilise the life that had passed me by in 2022, but either way, stability was truly what I needed this year.

# Main Lesson: Actions and Control

In the midst of change, I held to a few core principles and held my actions steady, even though the world around me pushed and pulled. At the end of the year, I am proud that I had steered my life rather than letting it steer me. 

A major part of stability is also control. The ability to control what you do, and how you react, despite being in an uncontrollable environment.

And a major mindset shift that I had this year was that who I am is defined by my actions alone, not what I say, or what I think. I started to take ownership of my actions rather than my thoughts (because who can see my thoughts anyway?) - both in my relationship and professionally. This meant shutting up, not giving excuses, and getting things done - one way or another.  

But more importantly, it was only in the later half of the year that I realised my actions are simply automatic decisions (mostly) that my brain/ body makes because mentally, I am following (i) the most frequently                                                                                                                                               ```used path and (ii) the path of least resistance. At this point, I started setting up systems - rules that simplified my decision making into an almost robotic manner. Since the human always fails at deciding to do the hard things and defaulting to familiar things instead, why not remove the human entirely?  

For example: 

- If on public transport for > 1 hour then listen to the How I Built This Podcast

- If have > 2 hours free and no other work to do for the night, then start coding

Other rules:

- Only subscribe to educational YT channels
- Disable Instagram on phone
- Set recurring calendar for birthdays

With these simple rules, I was able to get through hours of podcasts and multiple coding projects. The alternative was endless scrolling or gaming, neither of which would have made me any happier. Not to say that podcasts and coding make me happy, but at least they don't make me feel worse - bonus points for gaining knowledge as well.

I still haven't fully ingrained these rules yet. The podcast habit has stuck, but the coding one not so much because it requires extended focus - something I'll try to fix next year.

So that's my main takeways for the year. In the subsequent sections, I'll breakdown in detail what I've done, where I want to go, and how to get there.

# Past: Reviewing Milestones

In the past year, I:

- juggled 3 (now 2) jobs
- had 6 (now 4) cats
- bought a house
- got engaged
- got married
- reached a negative bank balance (momentarily)
- got a new job
- hit new PRs (officially in the 1000lbs club)

But also, there were aspects of my life that went as planned, and things that didn't:

| Area | What went well | Outcome | Improvements |
| - | - | - | - |
| Health | Kept to consistent 3x gym routine and nutrition as much as possible | Feel stronger than ever | Sleep consistency still lacking due to work schedule and tendency to stay up late |
| Relationsips | Kept a Really Rich mindset of generosity without expectation | Was kinder to others and experienced more reciprocity | Still not socially open enough. Need to meet a wider variety of people | 
| Professional | Deliberate career skills planning and practice | Unlocked more promising career path | Momentum to develop comes in waves. No regular progress review |
| Learning | Started writing and blogging without expectations | More reflective in personal growth. Able to retain more knowledge | Habit not consistent yet. Don't feel much excitement about what I do. |
| Leisure | Minimise scrolling social media and replace with educational content | Consuming much more useful content now compared to 1 year ago. Algorithm has been retrained. | Sometimes still feel bored from watching. Mindless scrolling is still an issue, although content is less corrosive | 

# Present: Reflecting on my current state and ambitions

Where am I at now? Where do I want to be?

My vision is for people to know me as the *fixer* - the guy who can fix your problems, or knows someone who can. I want to be the person that people know to come to when they have exhausted their options because I can help anyone, anywhere, and be appreciated and paid for it. 

Its a fantastical vision, evoking the images of shadowy figures who will solve all your problems for a fee without questioning morality or ethics. But the more realistic manifestation of this is the *dÃ©brouillard* or *System D* - the ability to get things done through resourcefulness and unconventional means, no matter the obstacles. Or as [Anthony Bourdian puts it](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/28/books/chapters/0528-1st-bour.html): 

> The ability to think fast, to adapt, to improvise when in danger of falling "in the weeds" or dans la merde, even if a little corner-cutting is required ...

I think this fits how my strengths are allocated.

| Trait | Natural Tendency (1 to 3) |
| - | - |
| Pure Intelligence | 2 (not a virtuoso but not dumb either) |
| Diligence | 1 (almost ADHD-like) |
| Social Influence | 1 (my weakest point is charisma) |
| Unconventional | 3 (my strongest trait) |
| 2nd-order thinking | 3 (able to plan ahead) |

Professionally, this means becoming the go-to person in my technology/ specialisation - which currently for me is the field of data.

And to achieve this, I need to:
1. Know what people need
2. Know where to find those things things
3. Deliver it to them in a box with a ribbon on it

This translates to 2 tangible goals:
- Become more knowledgable about data technologies through practical experience
- Become more involved in the community 

# Future: Planning the way forward and setting up systems

To get a working strategy for 2024, I will need to plan my actions in detail:

**1. Start with the Ends (goals, objectives, grand ambition)**

Breaking down the hairy goals above, I came up with 5 goals to meet for 2024:

- Be deliberate in all actions: do things with specific outcome in mind, and using a pre-formulated plan

- Have frequent reviews of actions w.r.t goals and calibrate if needed

- Preserve health, improve nutrition and sleep

- Develop professional skills (as mentioned [above](#present-reflecting-on-my-current-state-and-ambitions))

- Improve social influence 

**2. Take stock of available Means (resources like time, money, social capital)**

Time will be limited once my new job starts. I expect to be home only at 7.30pm daily, giving me 1.5 hours per day for fitness, self-development, dates, meetups, etc. Realistically, 2 nights will be for gym, 1 night for date night, and 1 night for meetups. 

Unlike this year, self-learning will have to be done during working hours. 

On the weekends, 1 day will be spent on part-time work, and 1 night on gym. That leaves Sunday for anything else. 

Time will be tight, so **efficiency** should be my main focus for next year. Cut out the non-essential and optimise everything else. 

**3. Plan the Way (specific steps to achieve the Ends given the Means)**

Ideally, the path to each goal should become so unobstructed that consistent action becomes automatic, possibly even the most attractive action to take. Wherever possible, I put systems and rules in place to automate (in the human context) these actions.

## Systems for 2024

This strategy results in 3 'systems' that I put in place:

**System 1: Regular review of actions and outcomes from them**

What it involves:
- Pre-booked timeblock in calendar, 1x per month (preferably Sat/Sun to avoid post-work fatigue)
- Fill up a templated list of Q&A (to reduce amount of creative thinking required)
- Q&A should address 'why am I doing this action' + 'what did this action achieve (if anything)'
- Use this time adjust actions, systems, and goals, if needed
- Also to book social meetups for the next/ following months (if any)
- Any other tasks like updating books to read or movies to watch

What it accomplishes:
- Keeps me deliberate in my actions
- Gives me frequent feedback so I can adjust course rather than waiting for end of the year.

I think this first system is the most important because it is the only form of feedback I will get regarding my performance. Usually this only comes once a year, at the end of the year, which is way too infrequent. 

**System 2. Reduce barriers to learning**

What it involves:
- Rule-based actions:

| If in this situation | Do this |
| - | - |
| Quick wait in line (5-10 mins) | Read a news article on feed |
| During meal alone (10 - 30 mins) | Watch YT documentary |
| Driving or time in between appointments (30 - 60 mins) | Podcast or Kobo |
| Free time block (>60 mins) | Coding, project, or blog | 

Examples of what I have set up:

- Curate YT account to only allow educational channels
- Set up personal blog for quick writing and logging thoughts
- Curate personal news feed like Feedly to easily read sources of interest
- Preload e-books into reader
- Prepare list of want-to-watch movies to prevent scrolling

What it accomplishes:
- Reduces the amount of thinking for decision-making 
- Replaces consumption of useless content with semi-useful content - learn by diffusion. 

**System 3. Non-negotiable nutrition and fitness**

What it involves:
- Smoothie with 1.5 scoops (45g) OR protein shake 2 scoops (60g), daily
- 2 x ZMA tablets + 1 x fish oil, daily
- Maintain 3x/ week gym

What it accomplishes:
- Feel stronger, recover faster

# Conclusion

As always, the end of year brings lots of reflection and lofty goals for the next year, most of which get dropped after January. With the [monthly review](/_posts/2023-12-29-monthly-review-2024.md), I'll be able to sustain this rather than just fantasizing about it.
